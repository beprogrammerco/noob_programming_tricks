## Welcome to how add ssh key in GitHub and Windows

### *First... ¿What the fuck is ssh key?* :worried:

#### Definition by google:

SSH Key is a protocol security that allow to user connect with a server or differents servers without need be login with his user and password each time that need do some action in the server. :sleepy:

**¿Don't you have any idea what that mean?**

:rage: **...**

Okey this is my definition for noobs:

> " This is only a protocol safer that allow connect differents services/servers.  **EXAMPLE: YOUR ACCOUNT GITHUB** avoiding the typical login and without exposing your credentials, then you only need have your private ssh key in the place that you want to register ( :neutral_face: Yes, yes, your pc for example ) and share the public ssh key to service as in this case your Github Account, and with that form github know that key is your pc and you can clone your repositorys, do differents actions without need of 1000 configurations ( Okey no that's not true, the others forms are very easier too, but using the ssh key you can be more **PRO** :sunglasses: ) "

### So, ¿What are the steps to do for this configuration? :confounded:

**First, Windows (In this case Windows 10/11):**

1. You need install Git in your computer, https://git-scm.com/.

*this is not a tutorial for how install github :joy: so, if you don't know, go to google bro*

2. Open your git Bash ( this programm will be installed when you are installing git )

3. configuring git

    - **Global credentials of git**
    - git config --global user.name "Your github name"
    - git config --global user.email "yourgithubemail@gmail.com"
