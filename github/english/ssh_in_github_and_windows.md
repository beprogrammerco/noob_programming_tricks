## Welcome to how add ssh key in GitHub and Windows

### *First... ¿What the fuck is ssh key?* :worried:

#### Definition by google:

SSH Key is a protocol security that allow to user connect with a server or differents servers without need be login with his user and password each time that need do some action in the server. :sleepy:

**¿Don't you have any idea what that mean?**

:rage: **...**

Okey this is my definition for noobs:

> " This shit is only a protocol safer that allow connect differents services/servers.  **EXAMPLE: YOUR ACCOUNT GITHUB** avoiding the typical login and you only need have your private ssh key in the place that you want to register ( :neutral_face: Yes, yes, your pc for example ) and share the public ssh key to service as in this case your Github Account, and with that form github know that key is your pc and you can clone your repositorys, do differents actions without need of do 1000 configuration ( Okey no that's not true, the others forms are very easier too, but using the ssh key you can be more **PRO** :sunglasses: ) "
